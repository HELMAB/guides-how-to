# How to install Google - GRPC - Extension PHP on Mac OSX

WIP

I had to install GRPC on my Mac OSX machine and I encountered some problems while following instructions on the official documentation. Below I will explain how I managed to force the installation of it.

First, the only one installation which work is the **manual installation**. For me, the PECL installation did not work !

## 1 - Installation of the prerequites

## 2 - Installation of the GRPC C Core

## 3 - Installation of the GRPC PHP Extension 

## 4 - Link GRPC php extension to my PHP 7
